> **I'm a French programmer in Tokyo.**

I used to work as a **JP-FR-ENG localizer**.

I started programming with `tone.js` as a nerd music lover.

Then I figured out I could use it to **automate** my boring work too.

Then I started doing it for my team. Then I was doing it full-time for my company.

Now that I'm hooked, I want to move to the next challenge and help develop great projects.
